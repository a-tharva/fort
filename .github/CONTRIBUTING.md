### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the password manager, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue . 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.

### Make Changes


### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. See [Atom's contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) to know how to use emoji for commit messages.

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: :sparkles:. 

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible.
